twitch2osu is a portable desktop[^1] application that allows you to redirect your [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) chat messages to your [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) DMs (with some extra quality-of-life features!).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The current version is deprecated and will be replaced by [a newer UI-based version](https://github.com/notiriscent/twitch2osu/issues/1)

## Get Started

To get started, just download the [lastest release](https://github.com/notiriscent/twitch2osu/releases) and run the executable file!

## Build

To build your own executable, follow these steps:
```bash

# 1. Clone the repo to any folder:
git clone

# 2. Install required Node.JS modules:
npm i

# 3. Run the build script:
npm run build
```

4. The freshly built executable is now in the `/build` folder!
